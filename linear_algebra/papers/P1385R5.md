# Introduction

Linear algebra is a mathematical discipline of ever-increasing importance, 
with direct application to a wide variety of problem domains, such as signal 
processing, computer graphics, medical imaging, scientific simulations, 
machine learning, analytics, financial modeling, and high-performance 
computing.  And yet, despite the relevance of linear algebra to so many 
aspects of modern computing, the C++ standard library does not include a 
set of linear algebra facilities. This paper proposes to remedy this deficit 
for C++23.

This paper should be read after P1166, in which we describe a high-level 
set of expectations for what a linear algebra library should contain.


# Goals

We expect that typical users of a standard linear algebra library are
likely to value two features above all else: ease-of-use (including
expressiveness), and high performance out of the box. This set of users 
will expect the ability to compose arithmetical expressions of linear 
algebra objects similar to what one might find in a textbook; indeed, 
this has been deemed a "must-have" feature by several participants in 
recent SG14 Linear Algebra SIG conference calls. And for a given 
arithmetical expression, they will expect run-time computational 
performance that is close to what they could obtain with an equivalent 
sequence of function calls to a more "traditional" linear algebra library, 
such as *LAPCK*, *Blaze*, *Eigen*, etc.

There also exists a set of linear algebra “super-users” who will value
most highly a third feature – the ability to customize underlying
infrastructure in order to maximize performance for specific problems
and computing platforms. These users seek the highest possible run-time
performance, and to achieve it, require the ability to customize any and
every portion of the library’s computational infrastructure.

With these high-level user requirements in mind, in this paper we propose 
an interface specification intended to achieve the following goals:

1. To provide a set of vocabulary types for representing the mathematical 
 objects and operations that are relevant to linear algebra;

1. To provide a public interface for linear algebra operations that is
   intuitive, teachable, and mimics the expressiveness of mathematical
   notation to the greatest *reasonable* extent;

1. To exhibit out-of-the-box performance in the neighborhood of that 
   of that exhibited by an equivalent sequence of function calls to a more 
   traditional linear algebra library, such as *LAPACK*, *Blaze*, *Eigen*, etc.;

1. To provide a set of building blocks that manage the source,
   ownership, lifetime, layout, and access of the memory required to
   represent the linear algebra vocabulary types, with the requirement
   that some of these building blocks are also suitable for (eventually)
   representing other interesting mathematical entities, such as quaternions, 
   octonions, and tensors;

1. To provide straightforward facilities and techniques for
   customization that enable users to optimize performance for their
   specific problem domain on their specific hardware; and,

1. To provide a *reasonable* level of granularity for customization so 
   that developers only have to implement a minimum set of types and 
   functions to integrate their performance enhancements with the rest of
   the linear algebra facilities described here.


# Definitions

When discussing linear algebra and related topics for a proposal such as
this, it is important to note that there are several overloaded terms
(such as *matrix*, *vector*, *dimension*, and *rank*) which must be
defined and disambiguated if such discussions are to be productive.
These terms have specific meanings in mathematics, as well as different,
but confusingly similar, meanings to C++ programmers.

In the following sections we provide definitions for relevant
mathematical concepts, C++ type design concepts, and describe how 
this proposal employs those overloaded terms in various contexts.


## Mathematical terms

In order to facilitate subsequent discussion, we first provide the
following *informal* set of definitions for important mathematical
concepts:

1.  A **vector space** is a collection of **vectors**, where vectors 
are objects that may be added together and multiplied by scalars.
Euclidean vectors are an example of a vector space, typically used
to represent displacements, as well as physical quantities such as
force or momentum. Linear algebra is concerned primarily with the
study of vector spaces.

1.  The **dimension** of a vector space is the minimum number of
coordinates required to specify any point within the space.

1.  A **matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or
expressions, arranged in rows and columns. A matrix having *m* rows
and *n* columns is said to have size *m* x *n*. Although matrices
can be used solve systems of simultaneous linear equations, they are
most commonly used to represent linear transformations, solve linear
least squares problems, and to explore and/or manipulate the
properties of vector spaces.

1.  The **rank** of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space
spanned by its columns, which is equal to the dimension of the
vector space spanned by its rows. The rank is also equal to the
maximum number of linearly-independent columns and rows.

1.  An **element** of a matrix is an individual member (number, symbol,
expression) of the rectangular array comprising the matrix, lying at
the intersection of a single row and a single column. In traditional
mathematical notation, row and column indexing is 1-based, where
rows are indexed from 1 to *m* and columns are indexed from 1 to
*n*. Given some matrix *A*, element *a*<sub>*11*</sub> refers to the
element in the upper left-hand corner of the array and element
*a*<sub>*mn*</sub> refers to the element in the lower right-hand
corner.

1.  A **row vector** is a matrix containing a single row; in other
words, a matrix of size *1* x *n*. In many applications of linear
algebra, row vectors represent spatial vectors.

1.  A **column vector** is a matrix containing a single column; in other
words, a matrix of size *m* x *1*. In many applications of linear
algebra, column vectors represent spatial vectors.

1.  **Element transforms** are non-arithmetical operations that modify
the relative positions of elements in a matrix, such as transpose,
column exchange, and row exchange.

1.  **Element arithmetic** refers to arithmetical operations that read
or modify the values of individual elements independently of other
elements, such assigning a value to a specific element or
multiplying a row by some value.

1. **Matrix arithmetic** refers to the assignment, addition,
subtraction, negation, multiplication, and determinant operations
defined for matrices, row vectors, and column vectors as wholes.

1. A **rectangular matrix** is a matrix requiring a full *m* x *n*
representation; that is, a matrix not possessing a special form,
such as identity, triangular, band, etc.

1. The **identity matrix** is a square matrix where all elements on the
diagonal are equal to one and all off-diagonal elements are equal to
zero.

1. A **triangular matrix** is a matrix where all elements above or
below the diagonal are zero; those with non-zero elements above the
diagonal are called *upper triangular*, while those with non-zero
elements below the diagonal are called *lower triangular*.

1. A **band matrix** is a sparse matrix whose non-zero entries are
confined to a diagonal band, lying on the main diagonal and zero or
more diagonals on either side.

1. **Decompositions** are complex sequences of arithmetic operations,
element arithmetic, and element transforms performed upon a matrix
that expose important mathematical properties of that matrix.
Several types of decomposition are often performed in solving
least-squares problems.

1. **Eigen-decompositions** are decompositions performed upon a
symmetric matrix in order to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors 
of that matrix; this is often performed when solving problems involving 
linear dynamic systems.


## Terms pertaining to C++ types

The following are terms used in this proposal that describe various
aspects of how the mathematical concepts described above in Section 3.1
might be implemented:

1.  An **array** is a data structure representing an indexable collection 
of objects (elements) such that each element is identified by at 
least one index. An array is said to be *one-dimensional* array if its 
elements are accessible with a single index; a *multi-dimensional* array 
is an array for which more than one index is required to access its 
elements.

1.  The **dimension** of an array refers to the number of indices
required to access an element of that array. The **rank** of an
array is a synonym for its dimension.

1.  This proposal uses the term **MathObj** to refer generically to one
of the C++ types described herein representing matrices and vectors (i.e.,
`matrix` and `vector`). These are the public-facing types developers will 
use in their code.

1.  An **engine** is an implementation type that manages the resources
associated with a *MathObj* instance.  This includes, at a minumum, the 
storage-related aspects of, and access to, the elements of a *MathObj*. 
It could also include execution-related aspects, such as an execution 
context. In this proposal, an engine object is a private member of a 
*MathObj*. Other than as a template parameter, engines are not part of 
a *MathObj*’s public interface.

1.  The adjective **dense** refers to a *MathObj* representation where
storage is allocated for every element.

1.  The adjective **sparse** refers to a *MathObj* representation where
storage is allocated only for non-zero elements;

1.  **Storage** is used by this proposal as a synonym for memory.

1.  **Traits** refers to a stateless class template that provides some
set of services, normalizing those services over its set of template
parameters.

1.  **Row size** and **column size** refer to the number of rows and
columns, respectively, that a *MathObj* represents, which must be
less than or equal to its row and column capacities, defined below.

1. **Row capacity** and **column capacity** refer to the maximum number
of rows and columns, respectively, that a *MathObj* can possibly
represent.

1. **Fixed-size** (FS) refers to an engine type whose row and column
sizes are fixed at instantiation time and constant thereafter.

1. **Fixed-capacity** (FC) refers to an engine type whose row and
column capacities are fixed at instantiation time and constant
thereafter.

1. **Dynamically re-sizable** (DR) refers to an engine type whose row
and column sizes and capacities may be changed at run time.

## Overloaded terms

This section describes how we use certain overloaded terms in this proposal 
and in future works.


### Matrix

The term *matrix* is frequently used by C++ programmers to mean a
general-purpose array of arbitrary size. For example, one of the authors
worked at a company where it was common practice to refer to 4-dimensional 
arrays as “4-dimensional matrices.”

In this proposal, we use the word *array* only to mean a data structure
whose elements are accessible using one or more indices, and which has
no invariants pertaining to higher-level or mathematical meaning.

We use *matrix* to mean the mathematical object as defined above in
Section 3.1, and `matrix` (in monospaced font) to mean the C++ class
template that implements the mathematical object. We sometimes use
`MathObj` (in monospaced font) in some of the component interface code
and text below to generically refer to a `matrix` or `vector` object.


### Vector

Likewise, many C++ programmers incorrectly use the term *vector* as a
synonym for “dynamically re-sizable array.” This bad habit is
reinforced by the unfortunate naming of `std::vector`.

This proposal uses the term *vector* to mean an element of a vector
space, per Section 3.1 above. Further, we also mean *vector* generically 
to have both of the meanings set out in 3.1, and `vector` (in monospaced 
font) is the C++ class template implementing those mathematical objects. 
We sometimes use `MathObj` (in monospaced font) in some of the component 
code interface code and test below to generically refer to a `vector` or 
`matrix` object.


### Dimension

In linear algebra, a vector space *V* is said to be of *dimension n*, or
be *n-dimensional*, if there exist *n* linearly independent vectors which
span *V*. This is another way of saying that *n* is the minimum number
of coordinates required to specify any point in *V*. However, in common
programming parlance, *dimension* refers to the number of indices used
to access an element in an array.

We use the term dimension both ways in this proposal, but try to do so
consistently and in a way that is clear from the context. For example, a
rotation matrix used by a game engine is two-dimensional data structure 
composed of three-dimensional row and column vectors. A vector describing 
an electric field is an example of a one-dimensional data structure that
could be implemented as a three-dimensional column vector.


### Rank

The *rank* of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by
its columns (or rows), which corresponds to the maximal number of
linearly independent columns (or rows) of that matrix. Rank also has 
another meaning in tensor analysis, where it is commonly used as a
synonym for a tensor’s *order*.

However, rank also has a meaning in computer science where it is used as
a synonym for dimension. In the C++ standard at [*meta.unary.prop.query*], 
rank is described as the number of dimensions of `T` if `T` names an array, 
otherwise it is zero.

We avoid using the term *rank* in this proposal in the context of linear
algebra, except as a quantity that might result from performing certain
decompositions wherein the mathematical rank of a matrix is computed.


# Scope

We contend that the best approach for standardizing a set of linear
algebra components for C++23 will be one that is layered, iterative, and
incremental. This paper is quite deliberately a “basic linear algebra-only”
proposal; it describes what we believe is a foundational layer providing
the minimum set of components and arithmetic operations necessary to provide 
a reasonable, basic level of functionality.

Higher-level functionality can be specified in terms of the interfaces
described here, and we encourage succession papers to explore this
possibility.


## Functional requirements

The foundational layer, as described here, should include the minimal
set of types and functions required to perform matrix arithmetic in
finite dimensional spaces. This includes:

+ Matrix and vector class templates;

+ Arithmetic operations for addition, subtraction, negation, and
multiplication of matrices and vectors;

+ Arithmetic operations for scalar multiplication of matrices and
vectors;

+ Well-defined facilities for integrating new element types;

+ Well-defined facilities for creating and integrating custom engines; and,

+ Well-defined facilities for creating and integrating custom arithmetic 
operations.


## Considered but excluded

**Tensors**

There has been a great deal of interest expressed in specifying an
interface for general-purpose tensor processing in which linear algebra
facilities fall out as a special case. We exclude this idea from this
proposal for two reasons. First, given the practical realities of
standardization work, the enormous scope of such an effort would very
likely delay introduction of linear algebra facilities until C++26 or
later.

Second, and more importantly, implementing matrices as derived types or
specializations of a general-purpose tensor type is bad type design.
Consider the following: a tensor is (informally) an array of
mathematical objects (numbers or functions) such that its elements
transform according to certain rules under a coordinate system change.
In a *p*-dimensional space, a tensor of rank *n* will have
*p*<sup>*n*</sup> elements. In particular, a rank-2 tensor in a
*p*-dimensional space may be represented by a *p* x *p* matrix having
certain invariants related to coordinate transformation not possessed by
all *p* x *p* matrices.

These defining characteristics of a tensor lead us to the crux of the
issue: every rank-2 tensor can be represented by a square matrix, but
not every square matrix represents a tensor. As one quickly realizes,
only a small fraction of all possible matrices are representations of
rank-2 tensors.

All of this is a long way of saying that the class invariants governing
a matrix type are quite different from those governing a tensor type,
and as such, the public interfaces of such types will also differ
substantially.

From this we conclude that matrices are not Liskov-substitutable for
rank-2 tensors, and therefore as matter of good type design, matrices
and tensors should be implemented as distinct types, perhaps with
appropriate inter-conversion operations.

This situation is analogous to the age-old object-oriented design
question: when designing a group of classes that represent geometric
shapes, is a square a kind of rectangle? In other words, should class
`square` be publicly derived from class `rectangle`? Mathematically,
yes, a square *is* a rectangle. But from the perspective of good
interface design, class `square` is not substitutable for class
`rectangle` and is usually best implemented as a distinct type having
no IS-A relationship with `rectangle`.

**Quaternions and octonions**

There has also been interest expressed in including other useful
mathematical objects, such as quaternions and octonions, as part of a
standard linear algebra library. Although element storage for these
types might be implemented using the engines described in this proposal,
quaternions and octonions represent mathematical concepts that are
fundamentally different from those of matrices and vectors.

As with tensors, the class invariants and public interfaces for
quaternions and octonions would be substantially different from that of
the linear algebra components. Liskov substitutability would not be
possible, and therefore quaternions and octonions should be implemented
as types distinct from the linear algebra types.


# Design aspects

The following describe several important aspects of the problem domain
affecting the design of the proposed interface. Importantly, these
aspects are orthogonal, and are addressable through judicious
combinations of template parameters and implementation type design.


## Memory source

Perhaps the first question to be answered is that of the source of
memory in which elements will reside. One can easily imagine multiple
sources of memory:

+ Elements reside in an external buffer allocated from the global heap.

+ Elements reside in an external buffer allocated by a custom allocator
and/or specialized heap.

+ Elements reside in an external fixed-size buffer that exists
independently of the *MathObj*, not allocated from a heap, and which
has a lifetime greater than that of the *MathObj*.

+ Elements reside in a fixed-size buffer that is a member of the
*MathObj* itself.

+ Elements reside collectively in a set of buffers distributed across
multiple machines.


## Addressing model

It is also possible that the memory used by a *MathObj* might be
addressed using what the standard calls a *pointer-like type*, also
known as a *fancy pointer*.

For example, consider an element buffer existing in a shared memory
segment managed by a custom allocator. In this case, the allocator 
might employ a fancy pointer type that performs location-independent
addressing based on a segment index and an offset into that segment.

One can also imagine a fancy pointer that is a handle to a memory
resource existing somewhere on a network, and addressing operations
require first mapping that resource into the local address space,
perhaps by copying over the network or by some magic sequence of RPC
invocations.


## Memory ownership

The next important questions pertain to memory ownership. Should the
memory in which elements reside be deallocated, and if so, what object
is responsible for performing the deallocation?

A *MathObj* might own the memory in which it stores its elements, or it 
might employ some non-owning view type, like `mdspan`, to manipulate 
elements owned by some other object.


## Capacity and resizability

As with `std::string` and `std::vector`, it is occasionally useful
for a *MathObj* to have excess storage capacity in order to reduce the
number of re-allocations required by anticipated future resizing operations. 
Some linear algebra libraries, like LAPACK, account for the fact that a
*MathObj*’s capacity may be different than its size. This capability was
of critical importance to the success of one author’s prior work in
functional MRI image analysis.

In other problem domains, like computer graphics, *MathObj*s are small
and always of the same size. In this case, the size and capacity are
equal, and there is no need for a *MathObj* to maintain or manage excess
capacity.


## Element layout

There are many ways to arrange the elements of a matrix in memory, the
most common in C++ being row-major dense rectangular. In Fortran-based
libraries, the two-dimensional arrays used to represent matrices are
usually column-major. There are also special arrangements of elements
for upper/lower triangular and banded diagonal matrices that are both
row-major and column-major. These arrangements of elements have been
well-known for many years, and libraries like LAPACK in the hands of a
knowledgeable user can use them to implement code that is optimal in
both time and space.


## Element access and indexing

In keeping with the goal of supporting a natural syntax, and in analogy
with the indexing operations provided by the random-access standard
library containers, it seems reasonable to provide both const and
non-const indexing for reading and writing individual elements.


## Element type

C++ supports a relatively narrow range of arithmetic types, lacking
direct support for arbitrary precision numbers and fixed-point numbers,
among others. Libraries exist to implement these types, and they should
not be precluded from use in a standard linear algebra library. It is
possible that individual elements of a *MathObj* may allocate memory,
and therefore an implementation cannot assume that element types have
trivial constructors or destructors.


## Mixed-element-type expressions

In general, when multiple built-in arithmetic types are present in an
arithmetical expression, the resulting type will have a precision
greater than or equal to that of the type with greatest precision in the
expression. In other words, to the greatest reasonable extent, information 
is preserved.

We contend that a similar principal should apply to expressions involving 
*MathObj*s where more than one element type is present. Arithmetic operations
involving *MathObj*s should, to the greatest reasonable extent, preserve 
element-wise information.

For example, just as the result of multiplying a `float` by a
`double` is a `double`, the result multiplying a matrix-of-`float`
by a matrix-of-`double` should be a matrix-of-`double`. We call the
process of determining the resulting element type *element promotion*.


## Mixed-engine expressions

In analogy with element type, *MathObj* expressions may include mixed
storage management strategies, as implemented by their corresponding
engine types. For example, consider the case of a fixed-size matrix
multiplied by a dynamically-resizable matrix. What is the engine type of
the resulting matrix?

Expression involving mixed engine types should not limit the
availability of basic arithmetic operations. This means that there
should be a mechanism for determining the engine type of the resulting
from such expressions. We call the process of determining the resulting
engine type *engine promotion*.

We contend that in most cases, the resulting engine type should be at 
least as "general" as the most "general" of the two engine types.
For example, one could make the argument that a dynamically-resizable
engine is more general that a fixed-size engine, and therefore an
the resulting engine type in an expression involving both these engine
types should be a dynamically-resizable engine.

However, there are cases in which it may be possible to choose a more 
performant engine at compile time.  For example, consider the case adding
a fixed-size matrix and a dynamically-resizable matrix.  Although size
checking must be performed at run time, the resulting engine might be
specified as fixed-size.


## Arithmetic customization

In pursuit of optimal performance, developers may want to customize
specific arithmetic operations, such as matrix-matrix or matrix-vector
multiplication.  Customization might be based on things like element 
layout in memory, fixed-size -vs- dynamically resizable, special hardware
capabilities, etc.

One such possible optimization is the use of multiple cores, perhaps
distributed across a network, to carry out multiplication on very large 
pairs of matrices, particularly in situations where the operation is used 
to produce a third matrix rather than modify one of the operands; the 
matrix multiplication operation is particularly amenable to this approach.

Developers may also wish to make use of SIMD intrinsics to enable
parallel evaluation of matrix multiplication. This is common in game
development environments where programs are written for very specific
platforms, where the make and model of processor is well defined. This
would impact on element layout and storage. Such work has already been
demonstrated in paper N4454.

It is possible that two operands may be associated with different arithmetic
customizations.  We call the process of determining which of those two 
customizations to employ when performing the actual arithmetic operations
*operation traits promotion*.


## Linear algebra and `constexpr`

The fundamental set of operations for linear algebra can all be
implemented in terms of a subset of the algorithms defined in the
`<algorithm>` header, all of which are marked `constexpr` since
C++20. Matrix and vector initialization is of course also possible at
compile time for objects whose sizes are known at compile time.


# Interface description

In this section, we describe the various types, operators, and functions
comprising the proposed interface. The reader should note that the
descriptions below are by no means ready for wording; rather, they are
intended to foster further discussions and refinements, and to serve
as a guide for hardy souls attempting to build implementations from this
specification.


## Overview

At the highest level, the interface is divided into three broad categories:

1. **Engines**, which are implementation types that manage the resources
associated with a *MothObj* instance, including memory ownership and lifetime, 
as well as element access; and, 

1. **MathObjs**, which provide a unified interface intended to model a 
corresponding mathematical abstraction (i.e., `vector`, `matrix`);

1. **Operators**, which provide the desired mathematical syntax and carry
out the promised arithmetic.

At a lower level, and somewhat behind the scenes, are a number of supporting 
traits types employed by the operators to determine the return type of 
the operator and perform the corresponding arithmetic operation.  There 
are several such traits types:

+ **Element promotion traits** determine the resulting element type of an
  arithmetic operation involving two *elements*. 

+ **Engine promotion traits** determine the resulting engine type of an
arithmetic operation involving *matrix* and/or *vector* objects.  As part 
of that process, this traits type uses the element promotion traits to 
determine the element type of the resulting engine.

+ **Arithmetic traits** determine the type and value of a *MathObj* 
resulting from an arithmetical operation.  As part of that process, 
this traits type uses the engine promotion traits to determine the 
engine type of the resulting *MathObj*.  Having determined the result 
type, the arithmetic traits also have a member function that carries 
out the actual computations.

+ **Operation traits** act as a "container" for element promotion, engine
promotion, and arithmetic traits.  This traits type is a template parameter 
to the *MathObj* types, and provides a way to inform an operator of the 
set of available arithmetic traits to be used when deciding how to perform 
an arithmetic operation.

+ **Operation selector traits** provide the means by which an arithmetic 
operator selects the operation traits that will perform the arithmetic. 
In the case where each operand has the same operation traits, the decision 
simple.  However, it is possible that the operands may be instantiated
with different operation traits types, and so the operator uses the
operation selector traits to decide which operation traits type to use 
for computing its result.  The proposed traits class 
`std::math::matrix_operation_traits` is the second of two suggested 
customization points.

The following sections describe the building blocks in more detail, 
starting at the lowest level, and working upward in order of dependency.

### Template parameter nomenclature

To avoid excessive visual noise in the code shown in the subsequent 
sections of this paper, we use the following abbreviation-based naming 
conventions for template parameters:

+ Parameter names `T`, `T1`, and `T2` represent element types. 

+ Parameter names `ET`, `ET1`, and `ET2` represent engine types.

+ Parameter names `OT`, `OT1`, and `OT2` represent operation traits types.

+ Parameter names `OP`, `OP1`, and `OP2` represent the operand types 
deduced by an arithmetic operator.

+ Parameter names `AT`, `AT1`, and `AT2` represent allocator types.

+ Parameter names `N`, `N1`, and `N2` represent the number of elements
in a fixed-size vector.

+ Parameter names `C`, `C1`, and `C2` represent the number of columns in
a fixed-size matrix.

+ Parameter names `R`, `R1`, and `R2` represent the number of rows in
a fixed-size matrix.

+ Parameter name `VCT` represents a vector engine's category tag type.
  
+ Parameter name `MCT` represents a matrix engine's category tag type.


## `std::math` namespace

We propose adding the new namespace `std::math` to the standard library to
contain the linear algebra facilities described in this paper.  There are
two reasons for this: first, in order to group a related set of mathematical
facilities in a meaningful and orderly fashion; and second, to distinguish
the mathematical vector type described in this proposal, `std::math::vector`, 
from the general-purpose container `std::vector`.

## Engine Types

The over-arching purpose of the engine types is to perform resource 
management on behalf of an associated, owning *MathObj* instance.  At a 
minimum, all of the engine types provide a basic interface for const element
indexing, determining row and column sizes, and determining row and column 
capacities. They also export public type aliases which specify their element 
type, whether or not they are dense, whether or not they are rectangular, 
whether or not they are resizable, whether or not their memory layout is 
row-major, and a 2-tuple for describing sizes and capacities.

It is important to note that an engine's resource management duties are 
primarily related to storage.  To that end, an engine may own the storage 
it manages and control its lifetime, or it may be non-owning and represent 
a view of storage owned by some other object.

One can also imagine engines that manage resources related to execution. 
This is an area of ongoing work and not yet addressed in this proposal.

If the vector engine category tag `VCT` is `readable_vector_engine_tag`, then
nested type aliases `pointer` and `reference` are equivalent to `const_pointer`
and `const_reference`, respectively.  

If the vector engine category tag `VCT` is `writable_vector_engine_tag`, then
nested type aliases `pointer` and `reference` are equivalent to 
`typename ET::pointer` and `typename ET::reference`, respectively.

## Operation traits

### `matrix_operation_traits`

Class `matrix_operation_traits` is a traits-style template parameter to 
`vector` and `matrix`.  Its purpose is to associate sets of element promotion
traits, engine promotion traits, and arithmetic traits with a *MathObj* so 
that those traits may be conveyed into an arithmetic operator.

This traits type is a customization point.  Users may override the default 
functionality it provides by creating a custom operation traits class in 
their own namespace, and defining only those members necessary to implement 
the desired custom behavior.

Class template `matrix_operation_traits_selector<OT1, OT2>` is used by the

traits types of the two operands.

## Arithmetic traits

This section defines a set of arithmetic traits types for negation, 
addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The purpose of each of these 
traits types is threefold:

1. to determine the element type of the resulting *MathObj*;

2. to determine the engine type of the resulting *MathObj*; and

3. to carry out the arithmetical operation and return its result.

The idea here is that arithmetic operators (described below) simply forward 
to the appropriate traits type, which does the heavy lifting.


### `matrix_negation_traits<OT, OP1>` 

Class template `matrix_negation_traits<OT, OP1>` is an arithmetic traits 
type that performs the negation of a *MathObj* and returns the result 
in another *MathObj* having an implementation-defined engine type.
There are two partial specializations to support the two overloaded 
negation operators described below.

Alias template `matrix_negation_traits_t<OT, OP1>` is used by the library 
to obtain the nested type `OT::negation_traits<OP1>`.

## Arithmetic operators

The arithmetic operators provide syntax that mimics common mathematical
notation, with computation executed by an arithmetic traits type 
specified by one of the operands' operation traits template parameters.

Readers will note that the return types of the overloaded operators 
described below are left unspecified.  This is a deliberate choice so
that implementers have the freedom to choose whatever default technique
for evaluationg expressions they desire; for example, by returning 
temporary objects, or by using expression templates, or perhaps by 
some hybrid technique.

# Customization

The library provides for several forms of customization: custom element types,
custom element promotion, custom engines, and custom arithmetical operations.  
The following sections show examples of each.

## Integrating a new element type

Suppose that you have created a new type that models a real number in some
way and you wish for that type to be used as a matrix element:

~~~~c++
class new_num
{
  public:
    new_num();
    new_num(new_num&&) = default;
    new_num(new_num const&) = default;
    template<class U>   new_num(U other);

    new_num&    operator =(new_num&&) = default;
    new_num&    operator =(new_num const&) = default;
    template<class U>   new_num&    operator =(U rhs);

    new_num     operator -() const;
    new_num     operator +() const;

    new_num&    operator +=(new_num rhs);
    new_num&    operator -=(new_num rhs);
    new_num&    operator *=(new_num rhs);
    new_num&    operator /=(new_num rhs);

    template<class U>   new_num&    operator +=(U rhs);
    template<class U>   new_num&    operator -=(U rhs);
    template<class U>   new_num&    operator *=(U rhs);
    template<class U>   new_num&    operator /=(U rhs);

    ...
};

inline bool operator ==(NewNum lhs, NewNum rhs);
template<class U> inline bool operator ==(NewNum lhs, U rhs);
template<class U> inline bool operator ==(U lhs, NewNum rhs);
...
//- other comparison operators...
...
//- other arithmetic operators...
...
                  inline new_num operator *(new_num lhs, new_num rhs);
template<class U> inline new_num operator *(new_num lhs, U rhs);
template<class U> inline new_num operator *(U lhs, new_num rhs);
~~~~

Assuming that this type works as intended, and that all arithmetic 
interactions with other types are handled the set of operator overloads 
that you provide, then all that is required for the library to accept 
`new_num` as an element type is to create a specialization of 
`number_traits`:

~~~~c++
template<>
struct std::math::number_traits<new_num>
{
    using is_field    = true_type;
    using is_nc_ring  = true_type;
    using is_ring     = true_type;
};
~~~~

By stating that `new_num` models at least a non-commutative ring, and by 
ensuring that its arithmetic operators functions as promised, the library's 
traits types will allow compiliation to succeed.  


## Custom element promotion

Suppose that you want the result of adding two `float` elements to be 
`double`.  Then you would create the following custom types in your 
namespace:

~~~~c++
//- Base template for custom element promotion
//
template<class T1, class T2>
struct element_add_traits_tst;

//- Promote any float/float addition to double.
//
template<>
struct element_add_traits_tst<float, float>
{
    using element_type = double;
};

//- Custom operation traits.
//
struct test_add_op_traits_tst
{
     template<class T1, class T2>
     using element_addition_traits = element_add_traits_tst<T1, T2>;
};
~~~~

The new operation traits could be used like this:

Note that this example assumes that an addition operation involving a fixed-size
matrix and a dynamically-resizable matrix, or two dynamically-resizable matrices
results in a dynamically-resizable matrix.

## Integrating a new engine type

Suppose that you want to add a custom fixed-size matrix engine that is
somehow different from `fs_matrix_engine`; perhaps it is instrumented in
some way for debugging, or uses fixed-size storage that is external to
the engine object.  It might look like this:

~~~~c++
template<class T, int32_t R, int32_t C>
class fs_matrix_engine_tst
{
  public:
    using engine_category = std::math::mutable_matrix_engine_tag;
    using element_type    = T;
    using value_type      = T;
    using reference       = T&;
    using pointer         = T*;
    using const_reference = T const&;
    using const_pointer   = T const*;
    using difference_type = std::ptrdiff_t;
    using index_type      = std::int_fast32_t;
    using size_type       = std::int_fast32_t;
    using size_tuple      = std::tuple<size_type, size_type>;

    using is_fixed_size   = std::true_type;
    using is_resizable    = std::false_type;

    using is_column_major = std::false_type;
    using is_dense        = std::true_type;
    using is_rectangular  = std::true_type;
    using is_row_major    = std::true_type;

    using column_view_type    = std::math::column_engine<fs_matrix_engine_tst>;
    using row_view_type       = std::math::row_engine<fs_matrix_engine_tst>;
    using transpose_view_type = std::math::transpose_engine<fs_matrix_engine_tst>;

  public:
    constexpr fs_matrix_engine_tst();
    constexpr fs_matrix_engine_tst(fs_matrix_engine_tst&&) = default;
    constexpr fs_matrix_engine_tst(fs_matrix_engine_tst const&) = default;

    constexpr fs_matrix_engine_tst&     operator =(fs_matrix_engine_tst&&) = default;
    constexpr fs_matrix_engine_tst&     operator =(fs_matrix_engine_tst const&) = default;

    constexpr const_reference   operator ()(index_type i, index_type j) const;

    constexpr index_type    columns() const noexcept;
    constexpr index_type    rows() const noexcept;
    constexpr size_tuple    size() const noexcept;

    constexpr size_type     column_capacity() const noexcept;
    constexpr size_type     row_capacity() const noexcept;
    constexpr size_tuple    capacity() const noexcept;

    constexpr reference     operator ()(index_type i, index_type j);

    constexpr void      assign(fs_matrix_engine_tst const& rhs);
    template<class ET2>
    constexpr void      assign(ET2 const& rhs);

    constexpr void      swap(fs_matrix_engine_tst& rhs) noexcept;
    constexpr void      swap_columns(index_type j1, index_type j2);
    constexpr void      swap_rows(index_type i1, index_type i2);

  private:
    ...         //- Implementation stuff
};
~~~~

For each arithmetic operation in which you expect the new engine type to 
be involved, you will need to provide a specialization 
of the engine promotion traits for that operation.  For example, let's 
assume that you're only interested in addition operations involving two 
operands having the new engine type, or where one operand has the standard 
fixed-size engine and the other has the new engine.  Then your engine 
promotion traits might look like this:

~~~~
//- Goal: Create a new fixed-size engine type and use it in arithmetic expressions.
//
template<class OT, class ET1, class ET2>
struct engine_add_traits_tst;

template<class OT, class T1, int32_t R1, int32_t C1, class T2, int32_t R2, int32_t C2>
struct engine_add_traits_tst<OT,
                             fs_matrix_engine_tst<T1, R1, C1>,
                             fs_matrix_engine_tst<T2, R2, C2>>
{
    using element_type = std::math::matrix_addition_element_t<OT, T1, T2>;
    using engine_type  = fs_matrix_engine_tst<element_type, R1, C1>;
};

template<class OT, class T1, int32_t R1, int32_t C1, class T2, int32_t R2, int32_t C2>
struct engine_add_traits_tst<OT,
                             fs_matrix_engine_tst<T1, R1, C1>,
                             std::math::fs_matrix_engine<T2, R2, C2>>
{
    using element_type = std::math::matrix_addition_element_t<OT, T1, T2>;
    using engine_type  = fs_matrix_engine_tst<element_type, R1, C1>;
};

template<class OT, class T1, int32_t R1, int32_t C1, class T2, int32_t R2, int32_t C2>
struct engine_add_traits_tst<OT,
                             std::math::fs_matrix_engine<T1, R1, C1>,
                             fs_matrix_engine_tst<T2, R2, C2>>
{
    using element_type = std::math::matrix_addition_element_t<OT, T1, T2>;
    using engine_type   = fs_matrix_engine_tst<element_type, R1, C1>;
};

//- This is a custom operation traits type!
//
struct add_op_traits_tst
{
    template<class T1, class T2>
    using element_addition_traits = element_add_traits_tst<T1, T2>;

    template<class T1, class T2>
    using engine_addition_traits = engine_add_traits_tst<T1, T2>;
};
~~~~

As we can see, these custom promotion traits dictate the resulting engine type 
for these particular cases.  Resulting usage might look like this:

~~~~c++
matrix<fs_matrix_engine<float, 2, 3>, matrix_operation_traits>              m1;
matrix<fs_matrix_engine_tst<float, 2, 3>, add_op_traits_tst>                m2;
matrix<dr_matrix_engine<float, allocator<float>>, matrix_operation_traits>  m3(2, 3);

//- mr1 --> matrix<fs_matrix_engine<float, 2, 3>, matrix_operation_traits>
//
auto    mr1 = m1 + m1;

//- mr2 --> matrix<fs_matrix_engine_tst<double, 2, 3>, add_op_traits_tst>
//
auto    mr2 = m2 + m2;

//- mr3 --> matrix<fs_matrix_engine_tst<double, 2, 3>, add_op_traits_tst>
//
auto    mr3 = m1 + m2;

//- mr4 --> matrix<dr_matrix_engine<double, allocator<double>>, add_op_traits_tst>
//
auto    mr4 = m1 + m3;
~~~~

Note that this example also assumes that an addition operation involving a 
fixed-size matrix and a dynamically-resizable matrix, or two 
dynamically-resizable matrices results in a dynamically-resizable matrix.


## Customizing an arithmetic operation

Suppose that you want to specialize the addition function for the addition of
two matrices that employ the custom engine above and whose sizes happen to be
3x4.

~~~~c++
//- Goal: Call a specialized addition function for addition of fixed-size matrix objects
// using the fixed-size test engine and having size 3x4.
//
template<class OT, class OP1, class OP2>
struct addition_traits_tst;

template<class OT>
struct addition_traits_tst<OT,
                           matrix<fs_matrix_engine_tst<double, 3, 4>, OT>,
                           matrix<fs_matrix_engine_tst<double, 3, 4>, OT>>
{
    using op_traits = OT;
    using engine_type = fs_matrix_engine_tst<double, 3, 4>;
    using result_type = matrix<engine_type, op_traits>;

    static result_type  add(matrix<fs_matrix_engine_tst<double, 3, 4>, OT> const& m1,
                            matrix<fs_matrix_engine_tst<double, 3, 4>, OT> const& m2);
};

//- This is a custom operation traits type!
//
struct test_add_op_traits_tst
{
    template<class T1, class T2>
    using element_addition_traits = element_add_traits_tst<T1, T2>;

    template<class OT, class ET1, class ET2>
    using engine_addition_traits = engine_add_traits_tst<OT, ET1, ET2>;

    template<class OT, class OP1, class OP2>
    using addition_traits = addition_traits_tst<OT, OP1, OP2>;
};
~~~~

Actual usage might look like this:

~~~~c++
matrix<fs_matrix_engine_tst<float, 3, 4>, add_op_traits_tst>    m1;
matrix<fs_matrix_engine_tst<double, 3, 4>, add_op_traits_tst>   m2;

//- mr1 --> matrix<fs_matrix_engine_tst<double, 3, 4>, add_op_traits_tst>
//
auto    mr1 = m1 + m1;    //- Calls matrix_addition_traits::add()

//- mr2 --> matrix<fs_matrix_engine_tst<double, 3, 4>, add_op_traits_tst>
//
auto    mr2 = m1 + m2;    //- Calls matrix_addition_traits::add()

//- mr3 --> matrix<fs_matrix_engine_tst<double, 3, 4>, add_op_traits_tst>
//
auto    mr3 = m2 + m2;    //- Calls matrix_addition_traits_tst::add()

# Meeting feedback

## Cologne 2019

At the Cologne 2019 meeting, a joint session of SG14, SG19, and SG6 was 
held on Friday 20-Jul-2019 and version R2 of this paper was presented.  A 
vote was held in the afternoon, and the room reached consensus to forward 
P1385 to LEWG subject to reconciling implementation with P1673.

In the intervening months, the authors of P1673 have put together an initial
implementation of the interface described therein, and provided it to the
authors of this proposal.  We are currently endeavoring to implement P1385
in terms of the interface expressed by P1673.

## Kona 2019

At the Kona 2019 meeting, draft version D1 of this paper was reviewed by 
LEWG(I) and a joint session of SG14 and SG19.  Both reviews were generally 
positive, several good suggestions were made, and some polls regarding 
future directions were taken.  


### LEWG(I) Polls and Feedback (Wednesday 2019-02-20)

There were a few polls taken in this session:

1. We want 0-based indexing as opposed to 1-based indexing. <br>
   (unanimous: 20)

1. We like having separate row_vector and column_vector types in addition to 
   matrix. <br>
   SF F N A SA (21 present)<br>
   3 0 5 4  4

1. We want explicitly named operations (e.g., dot and outer) in addition to 
   operators. <br>
   SF F N A SA (21 present) <br>
    8 5 2 1  0

1. Define engine/matrix classes in terms of mdspan + storage and mdspan concepts
   (e.g., extents), and expose an mdspan-esque interface.  This implies that 
   fs_ and dyn_ are combined into one template parametrized on extents (which 
   are either static or dynamic). <br>
   SF F N A SA (22 present) <br>
   6 2 7 0  0

There were some additional requests:

+ Provide some implementation and usage experience.
  
+ Provide a comparison with prior art.

+ Explore the re-usability of `mdspan` and `common_type`.

+ Be careful of allowing specializations of traits types that are part of 
  namespace `std`; be consistent with other traits.

### Feedback From Joint SG14/SG19 Session (Friday 2019-02-22)

+ Stick to 0-based indexing, for compatibility with current practice, and also
  for performance reasons.

+ Provide a fixed-size engine whose memory is dynamically allocated.
  
+ In this session, there was very broad agreement that the one-vector approach
  advocated by LEWG(I) was the way to proceed.

+ Outer product computation is rare in practice, so, the vector-vector 
  multiplication operator should return the inner product, and the outer
  product should be a named function.


### Other Suggestions Gathered at the Meeting

+ Experiment with executors for concurrent operations. 
  
+ Include an "audience table" (see [P1362R0](http://wg21.link/p1362r0), Section 
  4.4) showing feature levels and anticipated user sophistication for each.

+ Include tutorial material on how the library can be used and extended, with
  several illustrative examples.
